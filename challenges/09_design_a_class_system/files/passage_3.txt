An electrolyte is something that ionizes when it's dissolved in the right ionizing solvent, such as water. These substances contain ions and can conduct electricity in the right circumstances. Most soluble salts, acids, and bases are electrolytes, while some gases under the right conditions can act as electrolytes. Most people know electrolytes to be the mineral substances in the body's bloodstream that carry an electrical charge, but that's not the only chemical definition or use for them. However, much of the purpose of electrolytes are tied to maintaining balance and charge neutrality in the body's cells. All higher life forms require electrolytes to function.
