This very strong acid was once known as oil of vitriol, from the word for bitterness or nastiness. It's highly corrosive, and can corrode many metals, most organic compounds and living tissues, and even stone. Sulfuric acid's main industrial purpose is as an electrolyte in certain types of car batteries, due to its conductive properties that help the electricity to flow. Like sodium hydroxide and other electrolytes of its kind, it can cause extremely serious chemical burns if it touches the skin, and must be handled cautiously.
